### What I learned

I actually learned some stuff this time. mostly about drag and drop stuff from MDN.<br />
oh yeah and I wrote a sort of rendering library for this. you can use it if you want,
but I'm putting GPL-3 on it. capitalists owned lol (we live in a society)<br />
I probably learn a lot during these projects but I don't really keep track of any of it

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org): first reference for web things
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com): obviously
